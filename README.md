# Tamagotchi Crash Bandicoot

This game was made for an academic project at Politecnico di Torino for the course of [Computer Architecture](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=02GOLOV&p_a_acc=2023&p_header=S&p_lang=IT&multi=N).

It runs on the LPC1768 (LandTiger) board. It was programmed using C language and debugged using Keil ÂµVision IDE.

I took _inspiration_ from Crash Bandicoot. The models were created using GIMP and exported as an RGB565 Array using [this plugin](https://github.com/MrPozor/gimp_export565array) to be able to display them on the LandTiger board.
